Hello! We can use this as a log I suppose.

2/13 Sandra
    I added a sql file to the repository with the creation of a base user, fish_inventory, and alt_inventory
    The tables are not connected and there is currently no cart. I'm debating if we make carts their own things or an array of references in the user, tbd

    For the fish_inventory and alt_inventory suggestions its gonna be many-to-many connection, but need to decide best way

    Next task now that we have the data in database is to sync it to the actual program and website, but need to then add in ways to sign up users (log in page) and how thatll work in the code

    I didn't run the sql code in my own terminal bc want to do all group mod and suggestions first, I'm hoping theres a way to just have that all here
